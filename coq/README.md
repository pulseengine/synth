# Synth Coq Verification

This directory contains the Coq formalization and correctness proofs for the Synth WebAssembly-to-ARM compiler.

## Overview

Synth compiles WebAssembly to ARM assembly. This Coq development proves that the compilation preserves semantics - i.e., that compiled ARM code behaves identically to the original WebAssembly code.

```

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

1. **Infrastructure**
   - Integer representations (I32, I64) with modular arithmetic
   - State monads for processor state
   - ARM processor state model (16 registers + flags + VFP + memory)
   - WASM stack machine model (stack + locals + globals + memory)

2. **Instruction Sets**
   - 60+ ARM instructions formalized
   - 150+ WASM instructions formalized
   - Full operand2 (flexible operand) support for ARM

3. **Operational Semantics**
   - ARM execution semantics for arithmetic, bitwise, shift, move operations
   - WASM execution semantics for i32/i64 operations
   - Properties: determinacy, commutativity, associativity

4. **Compilation**
   - WASM→ARM compilation function
   - Register allocation strategy (stack-to-register mapping)
   - State correspondence relation

5. **Correctness Proofs** (6 / 151 operations proven)
   - ✅ I32.Add → ADD
   - ✅ I32.Sub → SUB
   - ✅ I32.Mul → MUL
   - ✅ I32.And → AND
   - ✅ I32.Or → ORR
   - ✅ I32.Xor → EOR

### ⏳ In Progress

6. **Remaining Operations** (145 / 151)
   - i32 arithmetic: 7 remaining (DivS, DivU, RemS, RemU, Clz, Ctz, Popcnt)
   - i32 comparison: 11 remaining (Eq, Ne, LtS, LtU, GtS, GtU, LeS, LeU, GeS, GeU, Eqz)
   - i64 operations: 40 remaining
   - f32 operations: 29 remaining (requires Flocq library)
   - f64 operations: 30 remaining (requires Flocq library)
   - Control flow: 10 remaining (branches, calls)
   - Memory: 18 remaining (loads, stores)

### 🔮 Future Work

7. **Floating-Point Verification**
   - Integrate Flocq library for IEEE 754 semantics
   - Prove VFP instruction correctness
   - Handle NaN, infinity, rounding modes

8. **Memory Model**
   - Formalize linear memory with bounds checking
   - Prove memory safety properties
   - Handle alignment requirements

9. **Control Flow**
   - Prove branch and call instructions
   - Handle function calls and returns
   - Prove structured control flow preservation

10. **Sail Integration**
    - Replace hand-written ARM semantics with Sail-generated
    - Use official ARM ASL specification
    - Automatic Coq generation from ARM architecture

11. **Proof Automation**
    - Build custom tactics for common proof patterns
    - Automate 70% of remaining proofs
    - Reduce proof time from days to hours

12. **End-to-End Theorem**
    - Prove full compiler correctness
    - Show that entire WASM programs compile correctly
    - Certification artifact for ISO 26262 ASIL D

## Example Proofs

### I32.Add Correctness

```coq
Theorem compile_i32_add_correct : forall wstate astate v1 v2 stack',
  wstate.(stack) = VI32 v2 :: VI32 v1 :: stack' ->
  get_reg astate R0 = v1 ->
  get_reg astate R1 = v2 ->
  exec_wasm_instr I32Add wstate =
    Some (mkWasmState
            (VI32 (I32.add v1 v2) :: stack')
            wstate.(locals)
            wstate.(globals)
            wstate.(memory)) ->
  exists astate',
    exec_program (compile_wasm_to_arm I32Add) astate = Some astate' /\
    get_reg astate' R0 = I32.add v1 v2.
Proof.
  (* Proof omitted - see Synth/Correctness.v *)
Qed.
```

This theorem states:
- **Given**: WASM stack with v1 and v2, ARM state with R0=v1 and R1=v2
- **When**: We execute WASM I32.Add and compiled ARM code
- **Then**: Both produce the same result: v1 + v2

## Verification Effort

### Time Estimates

Based on proof complexity:
- **Easy** (i32 arithmetic/bitwise): 1-2 days per operation
- **Medium** (i64, comparisons, shifts): 3-5 days per operation
- **Hard** (floating-point, memory, control flow): 5-10 days per operation

### Total Effort

- **Without automation**: 830 person-days (~3 years solo, ~12 months with team)
- **With automation** (70% reduction): 250 person-days (~9 months with team)
- **With Sail integration** (60% additional reduction): 100 person-days (~5 months with team)

### Current Progress

- 6 / 151 operations proven (4%)
- ~12 person-days invested
- Average: 2 days per operation (easy operations)

## ASIL D Certification

This Coq development is designed to meet ISO 26262 ASIL D requirements:

1. **Formal Specification**: ✅ ARM and WASM semantics formally defined
2. **Correctness Proof**: ⏳ 6 / 151 operations proven (4%)
3. **Tool Qualification**: ⏳ Coq itself must be qualified or trusted
4. **Documentation**: ✅ All definitions and proofs documented
5. **Traceability**: ✅ Direct correspondence to Rust implementation
6. **Completeness**: ⏳ Must prove all 151 operations

### Certification Artifacts

- `theories/**/*.v`: Formal specifications and proofs
- Proof certificates (`.vo` files)
- Coq extraction to OCaml (runnable verified code)
- Traceability matrix: WASM operation → ARM code → Coq proof

## Integration with Synth

### Correspondence to Rust Code

This Coq development mirrors the Rust implementation:

| Coq File | Rust File |
|----------|-----------|
| `ARM/ArmState.v` | `crates/synth-verify/src/arm_semantics.rs::ArmState` |
| `ARM/ArmInstructions.v` | `crates/synth-synthesis/src/rules.rs::ArmOp` |
| `WASM/WasmInstructions.v` | `crates/synth-synthesis/src/lib.rs::WasmOp` |
| `Synth/Compilation.v` | `crates/synth-synthesis/src/rules.rs::SynthesisRule` |

### Testing Strategy

1. **Property-based testing** (Rust + proptest): Random testing
2. **SMT verification** (Rust + Z3): Bounded verification
3. **Coq proofs**: Unbounded mathematical proof

All three approaches complement each other:
- Proptest finds bugs quickly
- Z3 verifies within bounds (e.g., 32-bit integers)
- Coq proves for all possible inputs
