## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Working - tested and functional |
| ⚠️ | Partial - implemented but incomplete or untested end-to-end |
| ❌ | Not implemented |
| 🔬 | Research/experimental |

## Core Compiler Pipeline

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| WASM/WAT parsing | ✅ | wasmparser + wat crate integration |
| WIT parsing | ✅ | Custom parser implemented |
| Instruction selection | ✅ | 151/151 WASM Core 1.0 ops → ARM |
| Optimizer bridge | ✅ | Wires instruction selection into pipeline |
| Peephole optimizer | ✅ | Strength reduction, constant folding |
| Register allocation | ✅ | Graph coloring, AAPCS-compliant |
| ARM code generation | ✅ | Thumb-2 encoding, conditional execution |
| ELF emission | ✅ | Valid ARM ELF with sections, symbols |
| Cortex-M support | ✅ | Vector table, startup code, AAPCS ABI |
| **End-to-end CLI** | ✅ | **`synth compile input.wat -o output.elf` works** |
| Multi-backend arch | ✅ | Backend trait, registry, 4 backends registered |
| Z3 formal verification | ✅ | SMT-based translation validation |

### What Works End-to-End

> `synth compile input.wat -o output.elf` takes a WAT file and produces a valid ARM ELF binary.
>
> `synth compile --demo add --verify` compiles and formally verifies the translation using Z3.
>
> 519 tests pass across 18 crates with 0 failures.

## WebAssembly Operations

| i64 arithmetic | 40 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ⚠️ partial |
| f32 operations | 29 | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ❌ |

- ✅ Core i32 operations verified via Z3 SMT solver (add, sub, mul, and, or, xor)
- ✅ 53 comprehensive Z3 verification tests pass
- ⚠️ Not all operations tested through full compile → ELF → execute path
- ⚠️ Control flow (if/else, loop, br) has rules but not tested end-to-end

## Multi-Backend Architecture

| Backend | Status | `compile_function()` | `compile_module()` |
|---------|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| ARM (built-in) | ✅ | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| w2c2 | ⚠️ | ❌ Stub | ❌ Stub |
| aWsm | ⚠️ | ❌ Stub | ❌ Stub |
| wasker | ⚠️ | ❌ Stub | ❌ Stub |

### Backend Trait

All backends implement `Backend` trait with: `name()`, `version()`, `is_available()`, `capabilities()`, `compile_function()`, `compile_module()`. BackendRegistry provides centralized discovery.

## Summary

### What Works

1. **End-to-end compilation:** `synth compile input.wat -o output.elf` produces valid ARM ELF
2. **Multi-function compilation:** `--all-exports` compiles all exported functions
3. **Cortex-M binaries:** `--cortex-m` generates complete embedded binaries
4. **Formal verification:** `--verify` proves translation correctness via Z3
5. **Multi-backend architecture:** Backend trait with registry, ARM backend functional
6. **CLI:** 8 commands (compile, verify, disasm, backends, parse, synthesize, target-info)
7. **519 tests pass** across 18 crates

### What Doesn't Work Yet

1. **End-to-end execution:** No WASM → ELF → execute → verify-result cycle
2. **External backends:** w2c2/aWsm/wasker stubs not implemented
3. **Hardware testing:** No tests on real devices yet
5. **Control flow end-to-end:** if/else/loop rules exist but untested through compile

### Next Steps

See [ROADMAP.md](/ROADMAP.md) for the plan.
